# Why decorators?

## But... not always?

So are there cases where decorators shouldn't be used?
Well, definitely yes.

Decorators are about readability, simplicity and elegance.
If a decorator does the opposite, then don't use it.

There are no hard rules for what good code is vs. bad,
and everyone could have a different understanding.
It honestly requires a lot of experience, learning and practice.
For me personally, I always try my best to write good code,
so that my colleagues don't hate me,
and more importantly, I don't hate myself.
