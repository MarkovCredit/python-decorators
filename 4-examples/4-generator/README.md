# Examples

Generator is a special type of function in Python that behaves as an iterator.
It is both easier to read and more efficient than using `list.append`
when building an iterable.

However in some cases a generator by itself may not fulfill what is needed.
In this case it can be combined with decorators to achieve more complex functionality.
