# What is a Python decorator?

Despite decorator being a very powerful tool in the Python language,
there is very limited mention of it in the [official documentations](https://docs.python.org).
(We'll see in a minute why).

However, there are a few places where the foundation is laid.

* [PEP 318](1-pep-318/README.md)

* [Glossary](2-glossary/README.md)

* [Function definitions](3-definition/README.md)
